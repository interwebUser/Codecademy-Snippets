# In our version of least significant digit radix sort, weâ€™re going to utilize
# the string representation of each integer. This, combined with negative 
# indexing, will allow us to count each digit in a number from right-to-left.

# Some other implementations utilize integer division and modular arithmetic 
# to find each digit in a radix sort, but our goal here is to build an 
# intuition for how the sort works.

# The Radix Sort Algorithm does the follow:
# -Takes numbers in an input list.
# -Passes through each digit in those numbers, from least to most significant.
# -Looks at the values of those digits.
# -Buckets the input list according to those digits.
# -Renders the results from that bucketing.
# -Repeats this process until the list is sorted.
