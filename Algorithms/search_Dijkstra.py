# How Dijkstra's Algorithm works in Python:
# 1. Instantiate a dictionary that will eventually map vertices to their distance from their start vertex
# 2. Assign the start vertex a distance of 0 in a min heap
# 3. Assign every other vertex a distance of infinity in a min heap
# 4. Remove the vertex with the smallest distance from the min heap and set that to the current vertex
# 5. For the current vertex, consider all of itâ€™s adjacent vertices and calculate the distance to them by (distance to the current vertex) + (edge weight of current vertex to adjacent vertex). If this new distance is less than its current distance, replace the distance.
# 6. Repeat 4 and 5 until the heap is empty
# 7. After the heap is empty, return the distances
# This algorithm has a runtime of O((V+E)logV) where V = # of vertices and E = # of edges
